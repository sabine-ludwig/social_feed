// Within the CreatePostForm component create a form with 2 input fields. 
// There should be an input field for the userâ€™s name, as well as the body of their post, 
// and each should be bound to its own state variable.

// Implement a handleSubmit method for your form, which should pass the entered 
// values to a function on the App.jsx component. That function should create a new 
// post object, add it to the existing array of posts, and update the App.js 
// state variable with the new array.
